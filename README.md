Multi-Population Mortality Modeling With Neural Networks
The point of departure for our training of neural networks is the article "A Neural Network Extension of the Lee-Carter Model to Multiple Populations", Richman and WÃ¼thrich (2018). We build upon the method and model presented there and extend it by looking at different datasets and introducing a hyperparameter search.
This use case was developed for the Working Group Statistical Methods within the Committee Actuarial Data Science of German Actuarial Association.

The German Association of Actuaries (Deutsche Aktuarvereinigunge.V., DAV) is the professional representation of all actuaries in Germany. It was founded in 1993 and has more than 5,400 members today. More than 700 members are involved in thirteen committees and in over 60 working groups as a voluntary commitment.

The given repositories have been created by committees and working groups and serve as an aid for our members and interested persons to support them in their work with machine learning methods and data science issues in an actuarial context.
